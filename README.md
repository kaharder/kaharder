# Hello There üßî‚Äç
##### General Kenobi! You are the bold one. ü§ñ

I am an Iowa State University student majoring in aerospace engineering and looking to learn my way around various code laguages. 

I am currently working on relearning Python, and will soon be learning C and LaTeX, both of which I am glad to learn as they seem critical in the working world. I already have a good foundation in Java and solid knowledge of MATLAB. 

I am interested in gaming, 3D printing, cycling, rock climbing, hunting, and robotics. It is also great to lounge around with a good book and cup'o'joe.
